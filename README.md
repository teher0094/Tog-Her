# Active Directory Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in setting up and managing an Active Directory (AD) environment using Microsoft Azure. I deployed 2 virtual machines (VMs), 1 VM for the domain controller (DC), the other as a client then I configured user groups and organizational units (OUs) for different departments.

### Key Features
- **VM Deployment**: Utilized Microsoft Azure to deploy VMs.
- **AD Environment**: Established a DC and client machine within AD.
